            Over the last two years, React Native has helped many developers quickly build high quality, mobile applications targeting multiple platforms. The community and the ecosystem of plugins and tooling around the technology has also helped many developers bring in all the functionality previously available only to native developers. In this talk, we will look at the current state of React Native and discuss the common pain points developers have. The talk will also summarize some of the discussions in the React Native core team and new ideas being tried out. We will cover the rationale behind efforts like moving documentation to a separate repo, reducing the surface area of the API, etc. Based on the work done by the contributors, we will map out what it may mean for React Native to hit a symbolic 1.0 release.

            The 'Serverless Architecture' has become massively popular this year, and for the right reasons. Itâ€™s zero-administration nature and pay-per-execution pricing model enable developers to manage less infrastructure and build more than ever. So what are developers actually building with it? David will explore different use cases for building microservices with Serverless technology. The talk will include real world serverless examples from companies & the open source world.

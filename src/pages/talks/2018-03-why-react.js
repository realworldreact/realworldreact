            As the Frontend Platform team at Eventbrite switched from
            Backbone/Marionette over to React, it had to convince other
            developers, managers, directors, and non-engineers that React was
            the right path. And the rationale for moving wasn’t just because
            React is insanely popular. There are many tangible benefits that
            make the effort of migrating worthwhile. New to React and want to
            learn a little about how it works? Seeking ammunition to convince
            your team to make the change? Come learn about why we made the
            decision to transition to React, through an introduction of how to
            build user interactions with React.

            React can make your D3 amazing. Want to animate 20,000 elements with
            React? I'll show you. Want to build a complex dataviz? You'll know
            how. Want to write maintainable dataviz components that you can
            reuse in any project? I gotchu, fam. This talk shows you everything
            I've learned about creating reusable and maintainable graphical
            components over 3 years of hammering away at the question: 'Jeez D3
            sure is hard to learn, how do we make this easier?'

            Hi I'm Swizec, a geek with a hat. Rumor has it my bird is more
            popular these days than my hat ðŸ¤” Iâ€™ve made some books and courses
            on web development and working on more. Been doing JavaScript since
            before jQuery was cool and building my first React component back in
            2015 blew my mind.

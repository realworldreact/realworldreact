            As web developers, we have incredible demands placed upon us.
            Expectations for the quality of websites are remarkably high, and
            continue to rise. Not only must websites be feature-rich and robust,
            they must load and run quickly on a near-infinite variety of devices
            and browsers all around the world. Oh, and do it with limited team
            members on an aggressive timeline. Come join Kyle Mathews, founder
            of Gatsby, as he talks about modern web performance. You'll learn
            the tools & techniques you can start using today to make your React
            sites super fast. Weâ€™ll discuss code splitting, link preload, greedy
            prefetching, header optimizations, service workers, and more using
            Gatsby as a case study for these techniques.

            Kyle is a tech entrepreneur based in San Francisco, CA. He's founded
            several startups and is now helping build a next generation open
            source JavaScript website framework called Gatsby that blends the
            speed and simplicity of static sites with the rich tooling and
            client-side capabilities of React.js.

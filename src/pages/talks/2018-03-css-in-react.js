            React has no standard way to style components. A slew of ideas and frameworks have grown out of the community. But, with so many CSS in JS solutions, how do you know which one to choose? In this talk, I will cover five different ways to style your React projects, and the pros and cons of each approach. From CSS Modules with SASS to Styled Components, youâ€™ll learn how each library works so that you know which one(s) best fits your needs.

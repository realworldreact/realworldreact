            At Docker, we are using GraphQL alongside our existing REST APIs and
            making it work without a GraphQL server. Instead, we use GraphQL
            client side, where it serves as the interface to our network layer
            and the glue that binds our components together. We have taken this
            approach as a progressive solution to the difficult problem of
            introducing GraphQL to an existing application stack. By breaking
            the rules a bit we gain many of the benefits that GraphQL provides
            immediately while spreading out the implementation over many
            releases. While a novel approach I also envision a future where
            running GraphQL on the client is not uncommon. With the advent of
            blockchain technology and the concept of “dapps” we must reconsider
            the role of the application that runs on the end user’s device. By
            running GraphQL on the client we can consume remote GraphQL
            services, interact directly with the blockchain, browser / native
            APIs, and more through GraphQL.

            Feather started her career at Accenture as a technical consultant in various Silicon Valley companies including Sun Microsystems, Robert Half, and Electronic Arts. She went on to work as a Java developer for various startups that didnâ€™t survive the first dot.com meltdown. After this she left the tech world to have a career as a working artist for several years. She returned to teach a web development bootcamp in both NYC and SF for General Assembly. She then went on to work as a full stack developer at Netflix for the next few years, and is now a front end developer at Nvidia. She lives in San Jose with her partner and the cutest dog on earth.

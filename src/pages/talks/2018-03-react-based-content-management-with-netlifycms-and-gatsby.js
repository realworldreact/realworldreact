            React is most often associated with Single Page Applications, but
            tools like Gatsby, React Static, Phenomic and Cuttlebelle has made
            React hyper-relevant for content driven websites as well. Netlify
            CMS is an open-source project with the goal of building a content
            management UI in React. It works with any static site generator, and
            makes content editors participate in the modern git-centric workflow
            that developers are used to. This talk will show how to use Netlify
            CMS with a Gatsby-based site, to build high-performant and
            infinitely-scalable sites with git-based content editing, a user
            friendly UI, and live browser previews - all without a backend.

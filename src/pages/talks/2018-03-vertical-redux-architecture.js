            At freeCodeCamp, we've built a large Redux app with lots of moving
            parts. But building large scale Redux apps can get quite
            frustrating. In this talk we'll cover some rules to mitigate common
            issues seen in large apps, structural guidelines inspired by
            Clojure(Script) frameworks, and Redux theory of actions as events
            that help keep your large app transparent and manageable.

            Berkeley is a San Francisco native and the CTO of freeCodeCamp.org,
            where students learn full-stack web development for free. He is also
            the author of Redux-Epic, a library built to do better async and
            server-side rendering in React with RxJS Observables. Previously,
            Berkeley worked as a professional consultant and instructor with
            Real World Reacton and over two years trained engineers from Twilio,

    "description": "As the Frontend Platform team at Eventbrite switched from Backbone/Marionette over to React, it had to convince other developers, managers, directors, and non-engineers that React was the right path. And the rationale for moving wasn‚Äôt just because React is insanely popular. There are many tangible benefits that make the effort of migrating worthwhile. New to React and want to learn a little about how it works? Seeking ammunition to convince your team to make the change? Come learn about why we made the decision to transition to React, through an introduction of how to build user interactions with React.",

    "description": "The promise of writing code for iOS and having it ‚Äújust work‚Äù out of the box on Android is a tempting one. That along with hot reloading code and the ability to push over the air updates to published apps make React Native a tempting proposition. This sounds too good to be true so what‚Äôs the catch? React Native is a framework for building native apps using Javascript. Many native developers rightly associate hybrid Javascript apps with disappointing consumer experiences and frustrating development environments. Over the years the same promises have been made by many other Javascript based frameworks, so why is React Native any different? This talk will be from the perspective of an experienced iOS developer who has been working with React Native for the last 2 years and has shipped several cross platform apps with it.",

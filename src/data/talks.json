    "description": "React revolutionized the way we build modern user interfaces. But before it took off, it was built to solve a few key problems when building apps for the web. In this short talk, we'll learn what those problems were and how React approached solving them."

    "name": "Why React?",
    "description": "As the Frontend Platform team at Eventbrite switched from Backbone/Marionette over to React, it had to convince other developers, managers, directors, and non-engineers that React was the right path. And the rationale for moving wasn’t just because React is insanely popular. There are many tangible benefits that make the effort of migrating worthwhile. New to React and want to learn a little about how it works? Seeking ammunition to convince your team to make the change? Come learn about why we made the decision to transition to React, through an introduction of how to build user interactions with React."

    "name": "Building Static Sites with React",
    "description": "This talk will focus on how we can use our existing knowledge of JavaScript and React to build rich static sites without the overhead of learning new technology. We can continue to leverage all the existing dev tools we know and love to build full React applications and then simply generate static files from our components. We’ll also discuss some options to add common server-side functionality to static sites without running a server."

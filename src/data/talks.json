    "description": "React revolutionized the way we build modern user interfaces. But before it took off, it was built to solve a few key problems when building apps for the web. In this short talk, we'll learn what those problems were and how React approached solving them.",

    "name": "Why React?",
    "description": "As the Frontend Platform team at Eventbrite switched from Backbone/Marionette over to React, it had to convince other developers, managers, directors, and non-engineers that React was the right path. And the rationale for moving wasn’t just because React is insanely popular. There are many tangible benefits that make the effort of migrating worthwhile. New to React and want to learn a little about how it works? Seeking ammunition to convince your team to make the change? Come learn about why we made the decision to transition to React, through an introduction of how to build user interactions with React.",

    "name": "Why I Love JSX!",
    "description": "JSX is an XML-like syntax extension to JavaScript, popularized by React. When seen for the first time it can often elicit bad memories of intermixing HTML and code, but JSX is *very* different! Let's learn exactly what it is, how it works, and even how you can use it outside of React.",

    "name": "From Imperative to Declarative",
    "description": "There are often many ways to solve the same problem. This talk explores two different approaches, imperative and declarative. We will look at code samples and discuss the relative merits of each, starting with vanilla JS then moving to more concrete examples in JSX.",
    "bio": "Feather started her career at Accenture as a technical consultant in various Silicon Valley companies including Sun Microsystems, Robert Half, and Electronic Arts. She went on to work as a Java developer for various startups that didn’t survive the first dot.com meltdown. After this she left the tech world to have a career as a working artist for several years. She returned to teach a web development bootcamp in both NYC and SF for General Assembly. She then went on to work as a full stack developer at Netflix for the next few years, and is now a front end developer at Nvidia. She lives in San Jose with her partner and the cutest dog on earth."

    "name": "Building Static Sites with React",
    "description": "This talk will focus on how we can use our existing knowledge of JavaScript and React to build rich static sites without the overhead of learning new technology. We can continue to leverage all the existing dev tools we know and love to build full React applications and then simply generate static files from our components. We’ll also discuss some options to add common server-side functionality to static sites without running a server."
